**Introduction:**
We agree with Starke et al. (2020): despite the current lack of direct clinical applications, artificial intelligence (AI) will undeniably transform the future of psychiatry. AI has led to algorithms that can perform more and more complex tasks by interpreting and learning from data (Dobrev, 2012). AI applications in psychiatry are receiving more attention, with a 3-fold increase in the number of PubMed/MEDLINE articles on IA in psychiatry over the past 3 years (N = 567 results). The impact of AI on the entire psychiatric profession is likely to be significant (Brown, Story, Mourão-Miranda, & Baker, 2019; Grisanzio et al., 2018; Huys, Maia, & Frank, 2016; Torous, Stern, Padmanabhan, Keshavan, & Perez, 2015). These effects will be felt not only through the advent of advanced applications in brain imaging (Starke et al., 2020) but also through the stratification and refinement of our clinical categories, a more profound challenge which ‘lies in its long-embattled nosology’ (Kendler, 2016).
